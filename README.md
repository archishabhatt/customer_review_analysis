# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Review Dataset

This project aims to use sentiment analysis techniques and apply them to context dependent words/sentences. This would help us in building a machine learning model that can classify consumer product opinions as positive or negative, and identify aspects or features of products worth discussion from consumers.


This repository contains the work done by Archisha Bhatt, Keshavi Dave and Keertana Gubbala on the their final project for CSE482 Big Data Analytics.
